# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a dose plotter for tracking medication, primarily psychiatric in nature

# Features
This project will have the following features:
- A web all that allows a user input the name, dosage, and frequency of a medication
- A graph that allows the user to see the cumulative dose over time. A slider will allow the user to set the specific date range to display.
- Crucially, the graph should NOT create aliasing artifacts depending on the date range selected. When zooming out, the trend displayed should be a smooth average of the sub-ranges.
- A way to export the data to a csv file
- A way to import data from a csv file
- A way to add or delete a medication
